### C++ Data Structures and

C++ is a mature multi-paradigm programming language that enables you to write high-level code with a high degree of control over the hardware. Today, significant parts of software infrastructure, including databases, browsers, multimedia frameworks, and GUI toolkits, are written in C++.

Here I start by learning C++ data structures and how to store data using linked lists, arrays, stacks, and queues, graphs.
